Hello!

* Are you bored with science and/or math?
* Is there a new concept that is tanking your grades?
* Looking for a knowledgeable, skilled, *entertaining* tutor?

I'm confident that I can teach you physics, math, biology, & chemistry! :D

# Science Skills
I minored in physics while getting a bachelors degree in biochemistry, so I've got a solid theoretical knowledge of all the major science topics. More importantly, I worked as an Oncology Research Associate for five years! Here are some impressive accomplishments from my science career:

* I'm an author on [this article on stopping cancer in The Scientist Magazine.](https://www.the-scientist.com/critic-at-large/control-alt-delete-cancer-35697)
* I co-authored [this international patent application on a high-throughput cancer test.](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2015179557A1/en)
* I star in [this $70K crowdfunding campaign for cancer research.](https://www.lifespan.io/campaigns/sens-control-alt-delete-cancer/)

Finally, I know how to fill a whiteboard with fancy science-y stuff.

^ But, you won't need to worry about things getting that complicated or boring ... because:


# I Make Science Fun!

Did you know that it's possible to make edible glow-in-the-dark drinks?!?

I'm a huge comedy nerd, so you know I had to get a rubber chicken for my workstation!

# Rates

I charge at a baseline rate of $30/hour. Rates are dependent upon:

* The topic that you need help with
  * I have nearly 10 years of biology experience, so I am *extremely* confident with that material. However, I only minored in physics ... so I won't be as graceful there.
* The location that you need
  * I typically tutor at the Los Gatos library, but we could meet somewhere else.
* The level of support that you need
  * Where are you at with baseline understanding? Do I need to prepare specialized lessons for you? Do you need help designing extra credit projects?
