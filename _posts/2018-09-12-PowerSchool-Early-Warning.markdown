The PowerSchool Early Warning Report pools together a variety of factors that indicate that a student is struggling academically:

* Poor Attendance
* Low Grades
* Insufficient Credit Completion
* Disciplinary Action

You can choose to look at the problems for all students *or* you can select students in a class. First I'll describe how to view the alerts for all of the students that are struggling.

Head on over to the left side of the PowerSchool dashboard and select "sqlReports" and then "Power Teacher Reports."

![Select SQL Reports]({{"/assets/PowerSchool_Warning/sqlReports_Power_Teacher_Reports.jpg"}})

The next option that you want to select is "Early Warning Report."

![Early Warning Report]({{"/assets/PowerSchool_Warning/Early_Warning_Report.jpg"}})

You could pull up a list of all students without or without Early Warnings here, but there isn't much reason to view all students. Be sure to select "Include Only Students With an EWS Alert."

![Select EWS Students]({{"/assets/PowerSchool_Warning/select_EWS_alert_students.jpg"}})

The output of this data request is very wide, so you may need to scroll off to the right to see the warnings.

![Various Alerts]({{"/assets/PowerSchool_Warning/various_alerts.jpg"}})

You can click on a warning for more information. In this case, the absentee warning was selected. You can see the number of absences in this new window.

![EWS Attendance]({{"/assets/PowerSchool_Warning/EWS_Attendance.jpg"}})

The Credit Status window also seems very helpful. You can see the students grade level, the number of credits that they have earned, and the number of credits that they are expected to have (based on their grade level).

In the event that you'd like to look at the warnings for a specific class, you can click the backpack icon from the "Current Classes" page.

![Current Classes]({{"/assets/PowerSchool_Warning/current_classes.jpg"}})

I imagine that it can be challenging to keep on top of all of the tasks as a teacher or school administrator. I attended some demos for PowerSchool earlier this week and I was impressed by all of the data that it manages to pool. I imagine it must improve teacher productivity!
