NOTE: This is a grant proposal that I drafted in 2012. It was not funded. I still have an interest in microglia, but that interest has transitioned into how aged hematopoietic stem cells might play a role in dysfunctional microglia leading to Alzheimer's Disease.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia in the elderly 1 . AD is a
progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of aggregated amyloid beta
(AB) (Ref. 2,3), clumps of hyperphosphorylated tau (PTAU) (Ref. 4), altered neuronal signaling (Ref. 5), and neuronal
apoptosis (Ref 2). The onset of AD correlates with age, and is thought to begin with AB deposition, which
may be driven by inflammation (Ref. 6). Attempts to reverse AB accumulation (Ref. 7) and reduce inflammation (Ref. 8) do
little to improve cognitive impairment despite their suspected involvement in neurodegeneration.

One pathway of AB-induced neuron damage may involve inflammatory cells such as reactive
microglia. The role of microglia in AD is not well understood, and is confounded by both
neuroprotective and neurotoxic roles of these cells (Ref. 9, 10). In late stages of AD, microglial accumulation
precedes neural loss (Ref. 11) and dense populations of microglia are found surrounding every major aspect of
Alzheimer's Disease: the AB (Ref. 2, 8), the PTAU (Ref. 12, 13), and necrotic neurons (Ref. 14). Interestingly, prior to AD these
immune system cells are known to keep AB levels in check, secrete neuroprotective cytokines, and
fight infection. This suggests that AD is accompanied by loss of microglial function (Ref. 15).

Microglia originate in the bone marrow as monocytes and cross the blood brain barrier before
maturing into fully differentiated microglia (Ref. 16, 18). Young microglia are far better able to phagocytose AB
when compared to aged microglia (Ref. 3, 11). Old microglia have significantly less AB phagocytic receptors (Ref. 3)
and produce less AB degradative enzymes (Ref. 11). Microglia secrete inflammatory cytokines as a signal to
degrade AB and under controlled ex vivo conditions, old microglia produce more inflammatory
cytokines than younger controls (Ref. 2,8,18).

This microglia induced inflammation negatively influences multiple avenues of AD
progression. It activates several kinases that are known to hyperphosphorylate tau, including MAPT,
p38-MAPK, and cdk5 (Ref. 13,19). Further, microglia induce gamma-secretase and beta-secretase to degrade
amyloid precursor protein into AB (Ref. 11). These inflammatory cytokines may also indirectly impair
cognitive function by upregulating AChE, an enzyme known to decrease various synaptic proteins (Ref. 13).

The old microglia that are found surrounding AB and PTAU in late stage AD have a fragmented
cytoplasm (Ref. 2) and are significantly larger than age-matched controls (Ref. 8), indicative of cellular senescence.
Old microglia are known to induce neuronal death through a partially characterized reactive oxygen
species mechanism (Ref. 2,6,20,21). It may be that microglia senescence precedes AD progression (Ref. 8). Importantly,
youthful microglia are known to have telomere maintenance genes activated 9 and shortened microglia
telomere length is associated with AD progression (Ref. 8,9). Indeed, various cell types have been shown to
maintain youthful function after have their telomeres extended, usually via a telomerase overexpression
motiff (Ref. 22). However, this author is unaware of any reports where telomerase overexpression was used to
restore the function of old microglia.

# Research Plan
This project will serve as a pilot study to characterize age-related loss of function in wild type
microglia. Further, the effects of telomerase overexpression on function in old microglia will also be
assessed. Primary microglia cultures will be derived from young and old mice. Gene expression (which
may assess housekeeping genes, GAPDH, Beta Actin; lysosomal acidification gene, Ostm-1; scavenger
receptor gene, SRA; neuroprotective cytokine, Arg-1; degradative enzyme, IDE; and inflammatory
cytokines, IL-1B, IL-6) will be performed using quantitative RT-PCR. These results will serve as a
baseline for “young” and “old” gene expression for the genes examined. Both young and old microglia
cells will then be immortalized by telomerase overexpression using a lentivirus as a delivery vector.
Gene expression for all four conditions (young microglia, old microglia, young microglia + LV-hTERT,
and old microglia + LV-hTERT) will then be assessed as described above to characterize any functional
restoration due to telomerase overexpression. Successful completion of this study will permit further
characterization of age-related functional loss in microglia and the screening of prospective
rejuvenation strategies in the near future.

# Methods

### Animals
Experiments will be performed using young (1–2 month old) and old (24-26 month old) C57BL/6 mice
obtained from the National Institute on Aging. Prior to primary cell culture isolation, animals will be
euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation.

### Microglia Purification
Primary brain tissue will be washed in cold 1 X PBS, then minced using small scissors. Brain tissue
will be gently dissociated by immersion into 10 mL (per brain) of digestive enzyme (dispase II solution
(2 U/mL), trypsin solution (0.05%)). Dissociated brain tissue will be placed in a 50 mL conical tube
and laid horizontally in an orbital shaker set to shake for 1 hour, at 37 °C at 150 rpm. Remnant tissue
chunks will be further homogenized by rapidly triturating with a 10 mL pipette with a wide bore to
prevent cell shearing. This will be carried out with a fully charged pipette aid. Enzyme activity will be
halted by diluting the resultant homogenate 1:1 with cold 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 1 X PBS.
Meninges and clumped cells will be removed with 70 um filtration (BD Biosciences, Boston, MA) to
obtain a suspension of single cells. Microglia cells will then be isolated from the single cell suspension
using MACS magnetic purification according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec).

### Quantitative real-time PCR
mRNA will be isolated using a magnetic mRNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions (New England Biolabs). mRNA template will be reverse transcribed and prepared for PCR
Last Updated 02/08/12 amplification using a SYBR Master Mix kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Origene).
Appropriate pre-validated primers will be obtained from Origene. Relative expression will be
standardized using GAPDH and beta-actin. All analysis will be performed on an Applied Biosystems
7700.

### Microglia HTERT Immortalization
Microglia will be immortalized using an hTERT lentivirus as per manufacturer protocol (Invitrogen,
NY).

### Microglia Culture
Microglial cells will be plated 2 d before an experiment in 35-mm coverslip-bottom dishes in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 25 ng/ml MCSF as previously
described (Ref. 7).

### Telomere Length Determination
Micorglia telomere lengths will be determined using flow cytometry fluorescence in situ hybridization
as per manufacturer protocol (Dako, CA).
