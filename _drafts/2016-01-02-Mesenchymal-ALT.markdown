telomeres rhoten w/ each divison. cancer needs telomere maintenance mechanism.
most humans use telomerase. some use alt.
ALT can coexist with telomerase in the same cancer populations.
there are drugs that target telomerase, so some cells may switch to alt.
telomeres are TTAGGG repeats w/ six protein shelterin complex.
loss of around 200 nucletodies / cell cycle until threshold of senesce of apotposis.
germ cells, stem cells, cancer cells avoid telomere shortneing w/ telomere maintenance mechanism.
TEL and ALT
telomerase has htert and terc.
adds telomeric repeats to 3' end w/ rna template. most human cell sod no t have telomerase activity.
atrx and daxx and h3.3 histome mutations are linked to ALT.
leaves open chromatin accessible to HR ptoritne. s
replication fork collapse could induce bread induced telomere synstheis. w/ inter or intra telomeric recominbation with HR.
alt markers heterogenous telomere length, high tsce, eCTR, ALT PML apbs.
embryonic origin of ALT?
telomerase upregulated in requent division. esc, gemline cells.
majroirty of alt is from mesenchymal tissues like obne, soft tissues, neuroendcine systems, peripheral nervous system, cental nervous system.
most immortalized alt are fibrobloasts
tigheter regulation of telomerase epxression in mesenchymal tissues could be why ALT>
altered control of sensce and/or crisis in mesenchymal cells excessive telomere damage and replication stress could cause LT activation or riddferntial regulation of recombiantion might favor ALT.
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (epitherlial cells lose epitherlial pheniatype and acquire mesenchymal features helps celsl to overcome sesncede during tumor progression ... mini ALT?)
EMT is linked w/ formation of APBs and telomere lengthening!!!
ALT chromatin is more relaxed. alt can be suppresed in hybrids (ALT repressor telo lines) ... that reprossor might be ATRX/DAXX.
# ALT and TEL in Vitro
ALT lines hTERT or hTERC transfection enginreed cells can have both TMMs.
BUT hybrids of GM847 with several telomerase positive lines dropped APBs and led to only teloemrase citivyt.
MEFs deficienty for TERT and Werner led to high tsces with telomerase, BUT not after WRN.  injecte dinto mice make ALT tumors.
HeLa and HT1080 HUGE telomeres after telomerase ovexpression had ALT hallmarks like ECTRs and apbS
# in vivo
both TMM reportedly found in glibolastoma multiforme, osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, liposarcomas, fibrous histyocytomas, peritoneal
mesothelioma [97]; adrenocortical carcinoma [34]; gastric carcinomas [61]; and Wilms tumors [98].
doesn't appear to be in the same cell. same tumor doe.
embryonic orgin implicate din telomere maintenance
alt tel complicted seem to switch. could have reprosessors for other.
anti tel and alt need to be built together.

Vitis 2018 Telomere Length Maintenance in Cancer: At the Crossroad between Telomerase and Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT)
















It is usually assumed that approximately the 85–90% of the tumors utilize telomerase, while the
other 10–15% of tumors utilize ALT for telomere maintenance [15]; but a very recent study, performed
on 18,430 samples across 31 cancer types, demonstrated that the 73% of the analyzed samples expressed
TERT, the 5% was associated with ALT, while the remaining 22% of tumors neither expressed TERT
nor harbored ALT-associated alterations [25].
