# Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT)

It is estimated that somewhere between 10% to 15% of all cancer cells have no detectable telomerase activity, and a significant proportion of these tumors rely on the alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism (ALT) (Shay 2012, Heaphy 2011) to maintain and/or elongate their telomeres through an as of yet poorly-described mechanism(s) involving homologous recombination (Cesare 2010). The therapeutic importance of this field is further highlighted by several studies reporting that some cancers contain both telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMM),(Gocha 2013, Costa 2006, Henson 2005, Hung 2013, Ulaner 2013, Venturini 2012) and in vitro as well as preclinical data indicate that telomerase inhibition may select for cancers that use ALT (Hu 2012, Xue 2011, Chen 2010, Chen 2010). Additionally, with the exception of gliomas, the presence of TMM in tumors is often associated with poor prognosis and survival (Hung 2013, Ulaner 2003, Smith 2003). In fact, detection of ALT in liposarcomas and osteosarcomas is often associated with either the worst or just as poor prognosis and survival for patients as telomerase is (Ulaner 2003, Cairney 2008, Venturini 2010). Nonetheless, the majority of academic and industry resources are currently directed toward telomerase as it is viewed as a nearly universal target for cancer cells (Cesare 2010, Shay 2001, Harley 2008, Cerone 2011), but due to the perceived shortcomings of only targeting telomerase, cancer researchers have proposed that the future of cancer therapies will involve combining inhibitors of both TMM (Shay 2012, Chen 2010, Folini 2009, Wang 2011, Temime-Smaali 2009).  This futuristic thinking is why the focus of my research at the SENS Foundations was on finding genes that are specific and essential to the ALT mechanism.

Given the minimal amount of support directed to researchers in the ALT field, it is no surprise that it is far behind anti-telomerase therapy. For instance, as of July 2013, searching the term ‘telomerase’ on PubMed gives about 12,000 results while searching ‘alternative lengthening of telomeres’ returns only 286 articles, which is merely about 2.4% of all telomerase-based work published to date. Yearly publication trends for the telomerase and ALT fields also suggest that telomerase research dramatically expanded after the invention of the TRAP assay, but a similarly robust assay capable of inducing a comparable trend for ALT has not been achieved yet. The gold standard for ALT activity is telomere length maintenance in the absence of telomerase (Cesare 2010), but several ALT-associated hallmarks have been identified. This type of TMM is thought to be dependent upon homologous recombination and DNA damage repair proteins (Chung 2012, Chung 2011, Jiang 2007), and cells maintaining telomeres in this fashion are reported to have heterogeneous telomere lengths, extra-chromosomal telomeric repeats (ECTR), which include partially double-stranded C-rich circular DNA (C-circles), and ALT-associated promyelocytic nuclear bodies (APBs) (Henson 2009). It is hypothesized that ALT telomere synthesis is a recombination-based mechanism that may be occurring in an APB (Chung 2012).  Inhibition of several APB-associated components or APB assembly in ALT-positive cells has been reported to induce senescence, cell death or telomere shortening and are thus potential anti-cancer targets (Cesare 2010, Jiang 2005, Wu 2003, Bhattacharyya 2009, D'Alcontres 2007).

Arrows indicate the invention of the most relevant assays for each field, namely the TRAP assay in 1994 (Kim 1994), the APB assay in 1999 (Yeager 1999) and the CC assay in 2009 (Henson 2009).

Telomerase inhibitors are currently in clinical trials and it is widely believed that this is a result of robust assays that allowed researchers and clinicians to reliably and quickly identify genes and compounds that target this TMM (Shay 2012, Cerone 2011). The telomerase field has been generating a wealth of data for decades in the same format of the NCI 60 viability screen of the late 80s (Shoemaker 2006) with assays such as the TRAP assay that originated in 1994 (Kim 1994) and the subsequent miniaturizations (Heller-Uszynska 2004), and high-content viability assays that have developed since (Cerone 2011). Using current ALT assays, several genes have been identified that modulate ALT activity, but virtually all these gene candidates are vital for many non-ALT cell functions and thus are not ideal therapeutic candidates (Cesare 2010, Hu 2012, Jiang 2007, Jiang 2005, Wu 2003, Bhattacharyya 2009, Osterwald 2012).  Overall, the currently most reliable assays for ALT activity, namely C-circle (CC) and APB assays, are very low throughput as they require DNA dot blotting (Henson 2009), advanced qPCR techniques (Lau 2013), or complex 3-dimensional confocal microscopy imaging (Osterwald 2011), which are all very labor and/or data intensive and thus not amenable to high-throughput screening of larger gene databases. In sum, a TRAP assay equivalent for ALT activity has not materialized yet.
