telormes protect dna maintain genomic stability\
cancer needs telomere length. telomerase or ALT
pathway unkown completlely.
ALT uses DNA repoat to meiantina telomeres.
telomeres have 3' single stranded tleomer overahng. folds back and invades double stranded telomere region to make t loop.

telomerase and ALT .
ALT telomere heterogenous telomere length, APBs, psontaneous DNA damage at telomere.
cancers that are mesenchymal origin are more commonly ALT. epithelial more telomerase. OStesarmcomas high frequency of ALT>  this suggests that cell differens are why one mechanism is favored over another.
mesenchymal stem cells express little to no telomerase (detction limit?) ... this might more go ALT cause teloemrase repression.
genetic alterations lead to ALT vs TEL.
mutations affecting teloemrase reguatlion may facilitate ALT activation.
muttiaonas assoicated with ALT activation are found in genes that suppress recombination. p53, ATRX, DAXX, H3F3A (last three do chromatin remodeling at telomere)
# p53 muttaion common in many tumors (it's a tumor suppression)
common in both TMM.
p53 mutation or impaired pathwyas in > 95% ALT. p53 muttaitons coulbe be permisisve for ALT cause loss of stopping recombainotoin.
in vitro fixing p53 suppresed HR/DNA synthesis/prolfierartion in ALT lines
p53 dysfunction lets cell bypas checkpoint for shortened telomeres. p53 mutation stops cell cycle checkpiont and dna damage singaling plus w/o teloemrease likly goes alt

#ATRX/ DAXX /H3F3A
ATRX/DAXX modulates telomeric chroamtin in S phase.
helps with G rich repeats (telomeres hieavy).
H3F3A mutations might mess with histone incorpartion. H3.3 can't get into telomeric rhoamtin anymore messying with heteromcrhoatin and opening to recombiantion. ATRX/DAXX mutations in vivo with or without p53.
# telomerase regulation
telomerase expression inhibition => ALT
297 gene signature suggests that ALT + cells have TERT repression.

TE3LOMERE SHORTEING leads to TMM. in cancer.
ALT invovles mutliple changes to start.
