# C-circle Assay

Extra-chromosomal telomeric repeats (ECTR) are one of the major phenotypes reported in ALT+ cells (Henson 2009,Cesare 2004).  The various ECTR types include: G-circles, C-circles (CC), and t-circles (Cesare 2010). Though there are various differences in the abundance of these circles among mortal, ALT and telomerase cell lines, the presence of CC at high levels is the most tightly correlated phenotype with ALT activity identified so far (Henson 2009). The presence of CC in 38 cancer cell lines isolated from various tissues and immortalized through a myriad of different ways is a testament to the strength of the CC assay (Henson 2009).  CC appear during immortalization at the same time as other markers of ALT activity (e.g., APBs) and they gradually decrease to undetectable levels the more ALT activity is inhibited (Henson 2009).
This assay has been successfully used to identify ALT as the telomere maintenance mechanism from blood samples of osteosarcoma patients and to confirm that many of the genes previously known to be involved in ALT also affect CC levels (Henson 2009). Though its isothermal expansion steps make this assay suitable to use by more labs without a PCR machine, the applicability of the original assay to high-throughput screening is very limited (Henson 2009). It requires 3-4 days of very extensive amplification, blotting, labeling and developing steps as well as a radioactive probe (Henson 2009) (Figure 4A), which is not an option for many research and diagnostic labs. A quantitative PCR-based version that can be done slightly faster does exist (Lau 2013), but it is even more labor intensive in both the setup and data analysis, and thus it is not very high-throughput friendly. We have developed a non-radioactive version of the original C-circle assay that takes less time to complete (Figure 6A-B), but it still requires DNA blotting and as such is not suitable for a high-throughput screening format. We are developing a high-throughput, ELISA-based version of the CC assay and it will be further described in the next section (see Figure 6).

Figure 4. The C-circle assay is tightly correlated with ALT activity (Henson 2009). To test for the presence of C-Circles, circular DNA present in samples is used as a template by phi29 DNA polymerase to produce linear sequences which are then probed for the resultant G-rich, telomeric repeat strands (A). This radioactive assay has been reported to accurately measure ALT activity in 38 different cell lines (B).  Typical CC assay results for a panel of ALT+ and TEL+ cell lines, as well as artificial CC (C96) samples is shown (C).
