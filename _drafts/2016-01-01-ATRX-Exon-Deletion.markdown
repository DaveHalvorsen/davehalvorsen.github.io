ALT telomerase indepednet.
thinks hr templated extension.
genetic and eipigentic chagnes aren't knockdownATRX/DAXX and histone h3.3 found in pancreatic neuroendocrine cancers, pediatric gloiobasltomas and iother Tumorsseems like those mutaitons ALT markersloss of ATRX protein and or gene mutatitnos are features of ALT
ALT has genome rearrangemnts, micronucleations, G2/M checkpoint, weird double strand break repeair.
ATRX/DAXX and histone variant H3.3 seems to repress ALT.
no telomere lengthening results in sesnece
ALT uses homolgoy directed recominbation.
ALT often have apbs w/ teloemric DNA and recomibnaition factors. heteronely telomeres. hyperactive HDR.
there is low frequency ALT conversion, so multiple mutations and /or epigentic alterations probably required
![Lovejoy_2012_Table1](/assets/ATRX_Exon_Deletion/Lovejoy_2012_Table1.png)
ATRX is undetectable or depleted from PML bodies in around 90$ of human alt cencer cell lines tested INXCLUDIGN alt lines from in vitro.
ALT stornglty linked to deficincy with ATRX/DAXX
MANIUPLATING ATRX/DAXX expression FAILED TO unleash ALT_TERRAALT genomes ais uinstable. ongoing genome instability, frequent micronuclei, high DNA damge. ALT does not seems to be just p53/Rb loss and loss of ATRX/DAXX. multiple steps are needed for ALT immortalization. makes esene cause transformation numbers are low
Lovejoy 2012 PLoS Genet Loss of ATRX, genome instability, altered DNA damage response hallmarks of ALT pathway


==================

cancer tneeds long telomres cuase shortening. TTAGGG. 10-15% cancers use ALT>
depleting ATRX isn't enough to cause ALT
likely permissive for ALT, but not the only thing needed.
ATRX issue may lead to stalled replication forks. fork restart neeeded HR to start which might lead to ALT
ATRX may help with G4 DNA replicaiton. it's absence => HR restart => ALT?

====================
Chro-mosome instability (CIN)
pNETs with loss of DAXX or ATRX show ALT and CIN
loss of ATRX/DAXX strongly linked with CIN>

multiple stumor progression in pNET. ATRX or ALT muttionas cause CIN. CIN causes genome heterogenity => sublcones for tumor => metastats.
blue cells mutations in DAXX or ATRX. green cells metatstic clone.
