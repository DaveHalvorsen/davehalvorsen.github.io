telomerase negative immortal cells use ALT_TERRAALT uses HR between telomeric repeats from independent chromosome ends
hr repression stops alt, but HR exact mechianism not nknown
long noncoding telomreirc RNA (TERRA) formds RNA:DNA hybrics w/ teloemric c rich strand.
RNaseH1 and single stranded DNA binding protein RPA. required for ALT
telomer extension required for immortal cells
15% of human cancers are alt
ALT telomeres ave TTAGGG)n
heterogenous telomer eelgnth, multiple telomereas in tnuuclear bodies w/ PML. APBs.
increased rates of teloemrei sequence exchange, eCTR, T-circles, ss C-circles and G circles.
most ALT ATRX loss expression. HR proteins found in apbS
RNA polymerase II makes TERRA from chormosome ends.
ALT cell U2OS has higher TERRA than telomerase cells.
TERRA mostly in APBs.
there's telomer trnascriitopn in ALT.
ALT cell suberlomeric TERRA CpG islands are hypomethylated and bound by RNAPII.
histone H32 trimehtylated at lysine 9 is lwoer.
unlike teloemrase, TERRA does not drop from S to G2 probably cause no ATRX.

terra helps w/ telomere maintenance by vy making teloemres substrates for HR. TERRA can create recombinogenic DNA:RNA strucutres by base pairing with the C rich strand of telomeres.
RNaseH1 dedgrades RNA within a hybrid is found at ALT teloemres
mosreso tehan telomerase postivie cancers.
depletion of RNAseH1 in U2OS cells causes rapid telomere loss cause HUGE telomeric circle esxcision.
the loss of ATRX in ALT cells may be why TERRA.
TERRA is jnot downregualted in ALT during s to g2. (TEL drops).
telomeric hybrides after RNA removed would expose ss C-rich DNA to bind RPA. COULD. RPA at telomeres probably causin HR between telomeric sequences.
RAD51 coated ss C rich tel DNA would be a recombinogenc complex allowing for G rich overhang binding that could jumpstart polymerase elongation of G overhang invation ... like BIR
