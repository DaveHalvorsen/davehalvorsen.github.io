"Telomerase inhibitor
effects on stem cells may thus be minor because these telomer-
ase-competent cells only proliferate intermittently and typically
have much longer telomeres than cancer cells."
most cancers reqactivate Telomerase
chromosome ends have telomeres TTAGGG from 15 - 20 kbp at birth, but someteimes less than 5 kbp in diseasestelomere binding proteins and t loopsprotect from seen broken.
DNA polymerase can't replicate end during lagging strand synthesis
no tmm means shortening
growth arrest triggers p53 DNA DDR
if RB and p53 disabled, continued division and fusions crisis
replicative sensescence is thought be be anti tumor
RNA componetnet hTR or hTERC has 11 bp template for telomeric repeats
hTERT is catalytic.
telomerase not in most tissues, but inhibitors could cause detrimental on hematopoeit cprogenitor cells, germline cells, epidermis and intestinal divide a lot
stem cell quiescent teloemrase activity neglibile.
telomerawse inhibotors might lead to drug resistant telomerase indpeendent cancers.
# viral
hTERT promoter is -1 to -200 <-> -400 gene therapy?
almost all advanced human cencers telomeras, most normal don't.
suicide gene strategy w/ intratumor injection of adenoviral vector?
# hTERT immunoterhapy
tumor antigens can initionat T lymphocyte responses.
hTERT could be tukoor antigen.
NORMAL cells w/ high teloemrase might be affected.
hTERT seems to be poor autoantigen in stem cells. authors of other paper killed tumor cells of prostate, lung, breast, colon, melanano w/o hurting CD34+ HSC VONDERHEIDE 2001
# rna
complement to hTR?
antisense to degrade mRNA would need 90% or more inhibition to see effect. hTR inhibtors might work at lower #.
hTR  olignoicuteide targeting template as enzymatic inhibitor
telomeras inhibots w/ esxisting therapies mightbe better overall.
more open to attack by host immune system.
sudice gene hTERT expressing cells,
