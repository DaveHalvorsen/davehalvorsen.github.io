telomere shortening happens so cancer needs TMMsmost use telomerase. some use ALT_Telomere_Synthesis_Models
APBs and telomerase in the same tumors
TMM not necessarily static
clinicaliccally interesting, cause ALT needs to be taken into account
ALT is recombination -based
ALT have long, thereogenous telomeres, APBs, ECT.
ALT is HUGE in mesenchymal Tumorscaused telomerase not seen in MSC?
nearly 60% osteosarcomas ALT_Telomere_Synthesis_Modelsoppostie epithelial tumors use telomerase more often
use is cells Specific'
previous studies reported ALT exoogneous expression telomerase => elongation short telomers w/ ALT charactersitics remaining
telomerase expression has also been shown to inhibit alters
fuisions of ALT and TEL yields complex data ... this seems to be ATRX dpeendent (citation needed, so ATRX article
  only some hybrid cells have both ALT markers and Telomerase
  ALT cells seems to inhibit telomerase
  previous studies showed tumors w ambiougous TMM. telomeease activity/apbs, long heterogenous telomers like ALT, but then have telomerase.
  prevous studies were'nt careful enough to show for sure that no contamination from surrounding tissues

human sarcomas mosaic for two types of cells tel and alt+
tumor mix!@ single method of tumor check isn't enough ... the 10-15% of alt tumors is from just checking for TRAP ... not sure about mix!
some tumors had small amount of alt positive or telomerase positione, so they'd be cateogrized simply and wrongly into ones
telomeasre inhibitorts need to clinically check for ALT activity for proper planning
