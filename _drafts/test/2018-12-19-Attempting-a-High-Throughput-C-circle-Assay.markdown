# ELISA-based C-circle Assay
As described previously, the challenges associated with the CC assay limit its use to mainly low-throughput experiments (Lau 2013, Henson 2009).  We are attempting to overcome that hurdle by incorporating detection technologies into the assay that are more amenable to high-throughput screening. We already succeeded in creating a non-radioactive version of the assay (Figure 6A-B), which reproduces the main results from the original CC assay study (Henson 2009) (Figure 4C). We are now working to make the CC assay detectable by ELISA using biotin-labeled capture probes and DIG-labeling the phi29-expanded RCA products (Figure 6C-D), which shorten time to detection and greatly simplify data collection and quantification. The goal is to achieve a high-throughput assay for CC like the TRAP assay is for telomerase activity (Cerone 2011). We had reasonably preliminary success with detecting CC amplification signals from ALT+ cell lines as quickly as less than 24 hours (Figure 6C-D), but significant work still needs to be done to improve the sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay. Once this assay is further developed, it could be used in addition to the 2-D APB assay described above to perform high-throughput genetic screens on ALT-associated genes. Also, the ELISA-based CC assay could potentially yield results in as little as 16-18 hours from sample DNA isolation to detection as opposed to the 2-4 days currently required for the original CC assay.

Figure 6. Development of novel C-circle assays by the OncoSENS team. The non-radioactive version of the CC assay shows similar sensitivity to the original assay (Henson 2009) (A-B).The ELISA-based CC assay attempts to incorporate the successful high-content aspects of the TRAP assay for telomerase activity into a C-circle assay format as shown in (C-D).  Though we are still exploring several different sample preparation methods to increase sensitivity and reproducibility, we can report successful detection of positive controls (C) and ALT+ samples for the assay (D). Heating as well as chemically mediated cleavage (D) of the RCA telomeric strands derived from CC show promising results. The intensity of the green color is directly proportional to the amount of sample detected by the assay.
