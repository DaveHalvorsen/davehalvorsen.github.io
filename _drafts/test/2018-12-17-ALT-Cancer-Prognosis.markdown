# Introduction
10 to 15% of cancers use ALT and anti TEL will select for ALT
most tumors use TEL, but ALT happens in minority of cases
ALT heterogenous telomeres < 3kb to > 50kb. APBs have telomeric DNA and TRF1/TRF2. DNA recomcingaiton and repair proteins RAD51 and Rad52
ALT found in tumors of epithelial origin (carcinomas br3ast, lung and kidney). found much higher in mesnchymal origin like liposarcomas, osteosarcomas and glioblastomas. posiibly because telomerase is repressed in mesencyhal lineage w/ slower division so less telomere hsortening.
ALT has wacky chromosomes +/-, anaphase bridges, chromosomal instability
liposarcomas are 20% of mesnchymal tumors. ALSO some liposarcomas don't appear to have TMM
TMM is associated w/ poor prognosis in a lost of mesnchyyaml origin Tumors. osteosarcoma telomerase exression linked w/ shorter progression free survival (telomerase unfavorable outcome).
In liposarcoma ALT linked w/ lower surival rate. ALT in glioblastoma multiforme is linked w/ longer survival.
APBs defining ALT. PML, TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, RAP1 and the MRN complex proteins MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1 for APB. APB key marker of ALT, which is why we made the HT assay. chromatin remodeling of telomerase promoters is linked to some ALT lines.
 the prognostic significance of ALT appears to be tissue and tumour type-specific
 n osteosarcoma, hTERT is a predictive indicator of worse prognosis, with a trend in favour of shorter progression-free survival in patients whose tumours expressed telomerase rather than ALT (Sanders et al, 2004),
 hile in glioblastoma multiforme the presence of ALT is actually indicative of a better prognosis (Hakin-Smith et al, 2003).

ATRX and DAXX form dimer and needed for incorporation of histone 3.3 into telomeres for stability. dysfunction of ATRX or DAXX leads to telomere instability, HR and ALT.
telomeres hexameric TTAGGG at ch romoksome ends. telomeres must be length handled. ALT and TEL 85%-890%.
cancers maintain telomere length w/ ALT or tEL. telomerase promoter mutation can start. ALT heterogenous telomere length and APBs,. HR, ECTR.

# ALT Liposarcomas
ALT is associated with poor Prognosis
link between hTR expression and poor prognosis in liposarcoma patients

![Liposarcoma](/assets/ALT_Cancer_Prognosis/Liposarcoma.jpg)
sig hTR differences found across phenotypes ALT, TEL, -/-. ALT and TEL had higher hTR then -, BUT TEL only had high hTERT.
prev studies showed hTR promoter CpG island methhylation linked to ALT (repression in mSc)
treatment of Tel− cell lines with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A and the demethylating agent 5-aza 2′deoxycytidine induced expression of hTR and hTERT, consistent with decreased methylation and increased association of acetylated histones at these gene promoters (Atkinson et al, 2005; Serakinci et al, 2006).
An increased binding of positively acting modifications, acetylation of histone H3 and histone H4, was shown in association with higher levels of hTR expression, while no significant differences were shown in association with hTERT expression
In addition, no significant alterations in the binding of the negatively acting modifications, tri-methyl lysine 9 of histone H3 and tri-methyl lysine 20 of histone H4, at the telomerase gene promoters were associated with either hTR or hTERT expression.
While hTERT expression was devoid of prognostic significance, statistical analysis highlighted a trend in favour of worse prognosis for patients with tumours expressing high levels of hTR.
he statistical analysis of our patient material with relation to TMM showed that patients with tumours expressing the ALT phenotype had the lowest survival rate at follow-up.
urthermore, those patients whose tumours neither expressed telomerase nor ALT had the highest survival rate with a lower HR for death than those expressing telomerase or the ALT phenotype, although this was only suggestive of significance when adjusted for tumour grade.
Similarly, the highest proportion of grade 3 tumours were found within the ALT group and the majority of Tel+ tumours were grade 2, while those that were ALT−/Tel− were mostly of the least aggressive grade 1.
he correlation between TMM, telomerase gene expression and the various tissue-specific clinical outcomes may reflect the underlying complexity of telomere biology in different tumour types and certainly is of great importance to understanding telomere maintenance and telomerase regulation.
While hTR expression held no prognostic significance within the ALT expressing subgroup, there was a trend in favour of a worse prognosis for patients with ALT− tumours expressing high levels of hTR. ... cause they can switch more easily?!?
ALT is strong predictor of poor outcome in liposarcomas
novel direct association between high levels of telomerase RNA gene expression and poor prognosis.

Cairney 2008 High level of telomerase RNA gene expression is associated with chromatin modification, the ALT phenotype and poor prognosis in liposarcoma

# ALT Leiomyosarcomas
ATRX expression seems to be lower in this tumor type. authors think ATRX loss is linked with ALT, but that more studies are required. ALT is 60% of this cancer type. poor clinical outcome
leiomyosarcoma is aggressive soft tissue sarcoma w/ poor patient survial. 53 to 62% of leuimyosarcomas use ALT. inactivation of ATRX or DAXX is linked w ALT. loss of ATRX found in 33% of tumors. none of 92 cases lost DAXX. no TERT rpomoter mutation detect. Chemotherapy doesn't appear to help .. they just die.

# ALT Osteosarcomas

![Osteosarcoma](/assets/ALT_Cancer_Prognosis/Osteosarcoma.jpg)
no difference in survival for ALT+ vs ALT- patients. no sig diff in ALT vs TEL that respond to chemo

# ALT Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
pNETs rare genetically weird. 40% pNETs linked w/ ALT.
loss of DAXX or ATRX more agttressive tumro.
more than 50% of pNET patients die w/i 10 years.
ATRX DAXX muttions found mutually exclusive. same pathway?
WT ATRX/DAXX had favorable outcome.
ALT linked to decreased relapse free, adverse outcomes./
