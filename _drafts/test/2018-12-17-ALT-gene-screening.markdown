# High-Throughput Screening of Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT)-Associated Cancer Genes

### Abstract
There are many proposed methods to inhibit growth of various types of cancer, but none are as universal as abrogating telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs). Telomerase has been widely studied for decades as a cancer target and as such telomerase-based anti-cancer strategies have received extensive support from academia and industry. High throughput telomerase-based assays have been extensively used to discover and develop various telomerase inhibitors that are now being tested in clinical trials.  However, a significant portion of cancer uses a telomerase-independent mechanism known as ALT, and recent reports suggest that some tumors may activate both TMMs simultaneously and that telomerase inhibition may select for ALT cancer activity. Thus, a combinational inhibition of both TMMs will most likely be required for a successful global anti-cancer strategy. Since the current lack of known ALT inhibitors is, according to leading researchers in the field, due to the absence of a reliable and high-throughput assay for this type of cancer activity, we propose to develop high-throughput versions of the common ALT activity assays to screen for potential genes in cancer cell lines that are involved in the ALT pathway. Our results will potentially generate invaluable genetic targets for the development of anti-cancer therapies that specifically shut down the ALT mechanism.

# Background

### Introduction
It is estimated that somewhere between 10% to 15% of all cancer cells have no detectable telomerase activity, and a significant proportion of these tumors rely on the alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism (ALT)1,2 to maintain and/or elongate their telomeres through an as of yet poorly-described mechanism(s) involving homologous recombination3. The therapeutic importance of this field is further highlighted by several studies reporting that some cancers contain both telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMM),4–9 and in vitro as well as preclinical data indicate that telomerase inhibition may select for cancers that use ALT10–13. Additionally, with the exception of gliomas, the presence of TMM in tumors is often associated with poor prognosis and survival7,8,14. In fact, detection of ALT in liposarcomas and osteosarcomas is often associated with either the worst or just as poor prognosis and survival for patients as telomerase is8,15,16. Nonetheless, the majority of academic and industry resources are currently directed toward telomerase as it is viewed as a nearly universal target for cancer cells3,17–19, but due to the perceived shortcomings of only targeting telomerase, cancer researchers have proposed that the future of cancer therapies will involve combining inhibitors of both TMM1,12,20–22.  This futuristic thinking is why the focus of the OncoSENS research team at Mountain View, CA is on finding genes that are specific and essential to the ALT mechanism.

Given the minimal amount of support directed to researchers in the ALT field, it is no surprise that it is far behind anti-telomerase therapy. For instance, as of July 2013, searching the term ‘telomerase’ on PubMed gives about 12,000 results while searching ‘alternative lengthening of telomeres’ returns only 286 articles, which is merely about 2.4% of all telomerase-based work published to date (Figure 1). Yearly publication trends for the telomerase and ALT fields (Figure 1) also suggest that telomerase research dramatically expanded after the invention of the TRAP assay, but a similarly robust assay capable of inducing a comparable trend for ALT has not been achieved yet. The gold standard for ALT activity is telomere length maintenance in the absence of telomerase3, but several ALT-associated hallmarks have been identified. This type of TMM is thought to be dependent upon homologous recombination and DNA damage repair proteins23–25, and cells maintaining telomeres in this fashion are reported to have heterogeneous telomere lengths, extra-chromosomal telomeric repeats (ECTR), which include partially double-stranded C-rich circular DNA (C-circles), and ALT-associated promyelocytic nuclear bodies (APBs)26. It is hypothesized that ALT telomere synthesis is a recombination-based mechanism that may be occurring in an APB (Figure 2)23.  Inhibition of several APB-associated components or APB assembly in ALT-positive cells has been reported to induce senescence, cell death or telomere shortening and are thus potential anti-cancer targets3,27–30 (see also Supplementary Table 1).

Telomerase inhibitors are currently in clinical trials and it is widely believed that this is a result of robust assays that allowed researchers and clinicians to reliably and quickly identify genes and compounds that target this TMM1,19. The telomerase field has been generating a wealth of data (Figure 1) for decades in the same format of the NCI 60 viability screen of the late 80s31 with assays such as the TRAP assay that originated in 199432 and the subsequent miniaturizations33, and high-content viability assays that have developed since19. Using current ALT assays, several genes have been identified that modulate ALT activity, but virtually all these gene candidates are vital for many non-ALT cell functions and thus are not ideal therapeutic candidates3,10,25,27–29,34.  Overall, the currently most reliable assays for ALT activity, namely C-circle (CC) and APB assays, are very low throughput as they require DNA dot blotting26, advanced qPCR techniques35, or complex 3-dimensional confocal microscopy imaging34, which are all very labor and/or data intensive and thus not amenable to high-throughput screening of larger gene databases. In sum, a TRAP assay equivalent for ALT activity has not materialized yet.

The OncoSENS team is working to overcome those limitations.  We are using the same type of low-throughput experiments described above to develop high-throughput assays for ALT activity. Our team has had success transitioning the original CC Assay, which relies on radioactive probes, to a safer luminescent reporter (DIG-based) format that does not require treatment of the samples with restriction enzymes and thus yields results much faster. Additionally, we have had some preliminary success in adapting the CC assay to a more high-throughput friendly, ELISA-based format (see below), which eliminates the need for radioactive probes and DNA blotting altogether. As for the APB assay, the advancements we have made in adapting this assay to work in a high-throughput fashion are even more promising (see below). Our version of the APB assay replicates key published data without the need for confocal microscopy or 3-D image reconstruction for quantitative analysis, which yields results faster than the original assay34.  

In summary, we are developing the first truly high-throughput assays for ALT activity in cancer cells. We hypothesize that by using these assays, we can quickly identify gene targets for ALT cancers by screening large gene datasets by RNA interference. This would allow us to narrow down gene candidates faster and focus on non-vital genetic targets that are unique to ALT activity and not required by every cell in the body, which unfortunately is the drawback of virtually all of the ALT-associated genes reported so far (Supplementary Table 1). The assays developed by this project could also be applied for screening molecular compounds for drug development targeting ALT-positive cancers.

### ALT telomere synthesis models

FIGURE 2

Figure 2. Proposed mechanisms of ALT activity.  An RCA-based synthesis model involving circular telomeric DNA may explain the presence of C-Circles (A), but the homologous recombination theory has more support (B)3.  The synthesis is believed to occur in an APB, which is composed of the assembly of several different proteins (C)23.

Unlike telomerase, which uses an RNA template and reverse transcriptase activity to modify telomere length, ALT is believed to involve DNA repair and recombination enzymes and a linear or circular DNA template (Figure 2)1,3.  This telomere synthesis activity is proposed to occur during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle inside APBs (Figure 2)23,34,37.  C-circles have been proposed to work as DNA templates during elongation of telomeric repeats by rolling circle amplification (RCA), but it is unclear so far if they are actively contributing to the ALT mechanism or are merely a by-product of recombination-based telomere elongation by ALT1,3,38. APBs were the first bona fide molecular markers of ALT activity identified in cancer cells36. However, there are only two ALT-positive, in vitro SV40-immortalized cell lines, namely AG11395 and C3-c16, that do not possess APBs26,39,40. Also, culture of ALT cells in conditions that cause growth arrest and senescence were found to artificially increase the formation of APBs25,41.
