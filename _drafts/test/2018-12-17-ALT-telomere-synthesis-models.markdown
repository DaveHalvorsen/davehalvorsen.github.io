# ALT Telomere Synthesis Models
Unlike telomerase, which uses an RNA template and reverse transcriptase activity to modify telomere length, ALT is believed to involve DNA repair and recombination enzymes and a linear or circular DNA template (Shay 2012, Cesare 2010).  This telomere synthesis activity is proposed to occur during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle inside APBs (Chung 2012, Osterwald 2011, Wu 2000).  C-circles have been proposed to work as DNA templates during elongation of telomeric repeats by rolling circle amplification (RCA), but it is unclear so far if they are actively contributing to the ALT mechanism or are merely a by-product of recombination-based telomere elongation by ALT (Shay 2012, Cesare 2010, Oganesian 2011). APBs were the first bona fide molecular markers of ALT activity identified in cancer cells (Yeager 1999). However, there are only two ALT-positive, in vitro SV40-immortalized cell lines, namely AG11395 and C3-c16, that do not possess APBs (Henson 2009, Cerone 2005, Fasching 2005). Also, culture of ALT cells in conditions that cause growth arrest and senescence were found to artificially increase the formation of APBs (Jiang 2007, Jiang 2009).

Figure 1. Proposed mechanisms of ALT activity.  An RCA-based synthesis model involving circular telomeric DNA may explain the presence of C-Circles (A), but the homologous recombination theory has more support (B) (Cesare 2010).  The synthesis is believed to occur in an APB, which is composed of the assembly of several different proteins (C) (Chung 2012).
