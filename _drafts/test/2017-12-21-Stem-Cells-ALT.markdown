PSC => three germ layers, self-renew, immortalizedPSCs include ESC and immortalizedPSCshave expression Oct4 and Nanog and strong alkaline phosphatase.
PSCs generally have HIG teloemrasese, but ALT may be present as well.
teloemresa are TTAGGG. end replicaiton problem shortening fusion, genome instability.
TERT and TERC extends telomeres.
telomere lenght goes up during primplanation, embro development, and PSC derivation
telomerase usulalyl only in stem cells, gemer cells, some white blood cells and ALT_Cancer_Prognosissometimes HR-based ALT occurs. up to 15% of dccanres.  w apbs and hterogenous long telomeres, ECTR, tSCE.
ALT and Teloemrase can coexist.
PSC chromatin strucutre open. goes repressive during differentiation. long telomeres required for stem cells.
at preimplanation embryoy stage, telomeres eem to be extended by ALT totipotent zygote => blastocyst and then telomerase is used for ontogenesis .
ESC telomere elongation H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 heterochromatic marks decrease at telomeres
zscan4 appers to e part of ALT_like process to rapidly elongate telomeres
ESC with short telomeres  are not as differntitaiton cappbgle.
ALT is found in porcine iPSCs
85 to 90% cancers use telomerase. DAXX, ATRX and H3.3 mutations found in telomerase negative cells w/ ALT.
ALT and TEL may coexist in PSCs.
telomerase reactivation WITH ALT simultaenous, H3.3 /ATRX colocalzies with telomere in PML bodies.
Zscan4 could elonag4t telomerew in ESCs by HR at ttloemres. Zwscan4 apperas to be essential for genome stable in ESC WITHOUT telomerase. MOUSE embryonsi cstem cells

Huang 2014 Telomere regulation in pluripotent stem cells


telomeres protect linear chromosoms. teloemrase restores telomere DNA, BUT alt has been shown  as well.
telomeres TTAGGG. bind and loop at chromosome ends.
telomease extends at 50-100 bp/cdll divions
ALT can do thousands of bp
after fertizlaiton and activation of egg, embryonic cells HUGE telomere lengthening. thousands of base pairs w/i 1-2 cell cycles. WITHOUT telomerase!!! embryoys seem to have high rates of t SCE. , telomere recombation proteins. effect seen in telomerase knockout mice, so ALT mechanism seems tob e required for preimmaplation of mammals.
telomerase goes up during blastocyst stage
zscan4 is reuqired for going 2 cell to 4 cell embryo. zscan4 postive state found in ESC populations colocalzieing witht elomeres and causing telomere elongation. zscan4 knockdown reduced divsion, decreased tsce, lowered telomere length. cells without szcanr 4 cell cycle arrest.
zscan4 addition to yamanka factor lead to longer telomeres than usual iPSC, more teratome fuormaiotn.
