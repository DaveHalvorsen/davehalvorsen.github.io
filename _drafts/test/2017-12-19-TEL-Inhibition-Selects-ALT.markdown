15% cancers use ALT_
HR. TERC gene knockouts in telomerase + cell lines => long suriving ALT clones LOOWWWWWW occurrence
ALT LONGGGGGG telomere eoverhangs from S phase.
telomeres are TTAGGG
anti telomerase cancer therapy is good idea cause most cancers ust telomerase.
BUT anti telomerase can select for ALT
atrx gene expression loss is common
fixing atrx in alt linces can turn off alt
TERC gene knkockouts in telomerase postivie human lines

TERC KO in two other telomerase positive can-
cer cell lines; HT1080 and HAP1 cells (no survival clones
were acquired from ∼ 1 × 10 8 cells) .... ATRX?

turn off telomerase, tumor growth slowed and telomere dysfunction checkpoints, BUT growth eventually turned back on when tumor turned on ALT activity.
4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible Telomerase
Reverse Transcriptase-Estrogen Receptor (TERT-ER T2 ) fusion
knockin allele (Jaskelioff et al., 2011). In the absence of 4-OHT,
mice homozygous for TERT ER (designated TERT ER/ER ) are telo-
merase activity deficient and sustain same cytogenetic and
cellular phenotypes of conventional TERT or TERC knockout
model
Freshly harvested 4-OHT-treated G 3-4
tumor cells mice were passaged directly through SCID mice WITH 4-OHT or vehicle
at P3 xenograft SCID nod mice
