# abstract
ALT telomeres recombination lengthening. DDR indpendently of telomer elenght. decided to look for sturcutal abnormal making ALT? NGS analyze DNA of ALT telomers. C type TCAGGG variant repeats found in ALT telomeres ARE binding site for nuclear recptors COUP-TF2 and TR4. nuclear recptoers recurited to telomeres and ALT characteristics were induced after incorporation of C type variatn repeat by a mutant tleomeres. the variant repeats thorughout ALT teloemres result from recombination telomereo replications spreading variant repats from proximal telomereic regions and allows for nuclear recotrp binding for more recombiatno.

# discisison
alt telomeres wit variant telomeric repeats . most common was c type.
mortal and telomerase + cells have variatn repeats in proxmal 2 kb of telomere.
ALT cells have complex HR replicaiton dispereses promxial repeats thorughout the teloemres.
C type variant abundant in ALT tlomeres. c ypte repeats binding high affienity.
this is specific to ALT.
nuclear recptors have high affintiy foro c type variant repat than normal g type TRF2 binds more stringly TR4 to normal telomere sequence. recuritment of nucelar recpotrs is thought to be blocke by shtlerin binding.

depleting nuclear recpotrs hurt ALT characteristics: apbs, ectr c circles, tsce, .
inserit c type into telomeres of telomrase postive lines causes recuritment of nuclear recptors. c and g tpe variant repeats incorpation led to alt assoicated cahracterstic like teloemre lenthgeing, heterogneity, meta TIFs and C circles.

BUT not copying of teloemre tags across chromosome ends, so this variant repeats isn't enough to make ALT happen in mimmortal tel poseitve cell liens.

model propsed nuclear recptors destabilize telomers by dropping hstlering binding.
variant repeats and cnulers recprot recruitment may make chroamtin permissive recombiantion feedback loop.
variatn repeats may also cause replciation depdent issues like stalled replication formsks and problem t loop formation.
nuclear repcotros may cause telomres to interact with eachtoerh in APBs.
