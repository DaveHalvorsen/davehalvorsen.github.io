hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC)
NSG mice are hihgly immunodeficient and good for cancer xenograft modleing
NOD/SCID/IL2R gnull (NSG)
normal NSG repopulating cells (SRCs)

CD45 (lymphocyte common antigen) is a receptor-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase that is expressed on all leucocyte
CD34 is a transmembrane phosphoglycoprotein, first identified on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.
CD41a The HIP8 monoclonal antibody specifically binds to the α-chain of CD41. CD41 is also known as Integrin αIIb or Platelet GPIIb. The calcium-dependent complex of CD41 and CD61 (β3 integrin or GPIIIa) is normally expressed on platelets and megakaryocytes

MM = mismatch oligonucleotide control

clinical trials of imetelstat indicates that could help with myelofibrosis.
this study used in vitro hematopoietic progenitor cell assays and in vivoe hematopoietc stem cell assays to see what imetalstat did to normal and MF HSCs/HPCs.
treatment of CD34+ with imetelstat reduced numbers of MF, BUT NOT cord blood HPCs.
not normal CD34+ ALDH+ cells didn't matter patients mutational situation.
immunodiefinct mice w/ MF splenic CD34+ with imetelstat at 15 mg/kg 3 times /w ekk 4 weeks DID NOT HURT normal severe combined immunodefinciy repopulated cells, BUT did cause reduction in human MF cell chimerism and mutated donor cellls. seen for at least 3 months afte drug stoppe.d
linked to telomerase anti and induciton of apoptosis.
myelofibrosis and thrmboycytehmia or polycythemia vera myelobriboris cause sturctural remoding of marryow. limited surival. MF originates at HSC level.
tleoemrase hTERT enzyme, RNA hTR. extends telomeres. somatic cells don't have teloemrase.
imetelstate 13-mer oligonuclted complentary to tleoemrase rRNA cxomponent binds. occompetivie inhibiton of teloemrase enzym.e
seems to stop teloemrase acitivty and proliferation of severl cancers.
imeteal state stops lprofleration and causes apotposis in cancer stem cells.

imetelstate led to reverasle of bone marrow fibrosis and remisions in some patients with MF (another study).
imtetsltate can modify disease state.






imetelstate depleted MF myeloid progenitors and selectively malignant SRCs.
Normal CD34+ cells DID not inhibit normal hematopoiesis.
imetelstat may be able to spare HSCs in MF spleen.
clinical trials possibly cause hits MF vs normal.
REF 19 sees something similar against AML (xenograft model)
CLINICAL trials showed hepatotxciity, myelosuppression, and bleeding . thrombycotipenia was major dose limiting toxicity.
others have suggested off target effects causing those issues
THIS PAPER DID IN VIVO AND IN VTIRO w/  imetelsate, velhicle to see hTR hybridizintion.

dose and schedule from clinical on human did not inhibit normal human SRCs, but did reduce MF SRCs by 50% with CD 34+ from 2 / 3 MF patients FIGURE 3 AND 4.






pateint dereived xenograft model imetelstate depleted MF SRCs but not normal FIGURE 4B-C
imetelstate killed MF HSCs that could have repopulated secondary hosts Figure 4D-E.
imetelstate suppressed TA of MF CD34+ cells and caused apoptosis.
telomere length of MF stem and progenitor cells was 2x shorter as compared to normal
FIGURE 4B-C imetelstate worked in MF patients regardless of driver mutational status.

in vivo studies reduced # of normal hCD45+CD41a+ mature megakaryocytes seen in mice transplanted with CB CD34+ cells from 2/ 3 pooled samples transplaneted after 3 months of discontinuation of imetalstate SUPPLEMETNAL FIGURE 2.

normal HSCs/HPCs weree modelyt affected FIGURE 3B-C
![Figure_3](/assets/Wang_2018/Figure_3.png)
high dose of imetelstate migh hurt platelet creation. => thrombocytopenia.

CONCLUSION  
imetelstat can selectivley hurt bad HSC/HPC from pateint with MF by inhibitoing Teloemrase and causing apoptosis.
