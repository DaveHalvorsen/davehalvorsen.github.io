# Introduction
interchormosmal telomer elength variation knockdownchromosmal sorting and telomer ic repeat content analysis in GM130B cells. eachc hromosme could be siislated except chromosmes 1 and 2 and 9-12. ioslate din griup.
teloemre length was correlated with correspoding chromosme.
this ws first link betwene telomere length and chormosme size.
TRF is used as indicator, but problematic. doesn't / chromosme.





* TRF telomere restriction fragment (TTAGGG)3 probe
digest RsaI and Mspi. separetion on gel. find position of highest singal.

* RTC each sample had more than 300,000 chromosomes around 50 ng. signal intenstiy of TTAGGG)3. stipped and reprobed for CCT)7 used to normalzie amount of blotted NA. converted to teloemric repeatsby size in megabases of each chromoseome.

* TFU telomere fluorescence units in situ hybridization on metaphase chromosomes. large number of spreads needed.
# relative telomereic repat content between chromosomes
gm130B RTC values calcuated number of telomeric repeats across individual autosomal chromosmes recovered by FACS.
normal karytope. telomerase epxresion.
all chorsomes individually except 1-2 and 9-12. grups (2a figure).

# elomre length distribution of individual chromeomses in TRF
trf analysis only average telomere elgnth highest TRF intenstiy.
fragstion of each chromsome totals trf smear.
net telomer elgnth was caclated by adding 2000bp and mapped back to trf smear.

# Discussion
RTC value neat way to get tleomere length of individual chromosomes
TRF analysis has subtelmoerc region. RTC is just lienarly to TTAGGG, so it's better.
300,000 identical chromosomes at a time so high reproducibility.
RTC values of each chormosmase correlated with crhomosme size.
NaOH opens up, so more linear.
telomerae in various cancers. most cancers have long telomeres
TRF would imply that cancdr can divide a long time
BUT, the shortest tleomere may be what's critical for celllar sensence. TRF length of 2735 was hortest in chromosme 21. average was 3998 bp.
15 to 42 rpelications possible by assuming subtelomere is 2000 bp.  and 48 bp shortneing every divison.
teloemre proectes from recombiantion.
