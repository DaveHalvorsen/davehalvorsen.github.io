# Comparing Methods of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Production
NOTE: This is a grant proposal that I drafted in 2013. It was not funded. I still have an interest in Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) being used to treat osteoporosis, BUT I now have concerns that MSC therapy may lead to cancer that use the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres mechanism. I will detail my MSC => ALT concerns in a future article.

# Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a progenitor population believed to exist throughout the body that migrates toward and replaces damaged tissue.  The age-induced dysfunction of this reparative stem cell is proposed to play a role in a wide range of diseases.  Treatment with healthy MSC has been linked to increased lifespan and is reported to treat muscle, bone, and cartilage diseases.  MSC’s extensive distribution following transplantation, differentiation into many cell types, ability to migrate and successful use as a method of gene delivery make MSC transplantation a prime candidate as a rejuvenation therapy.  Despite all of the support for the use of MSC to treat the diseases of aging, the first attempt at producing the cells on a scale required to treat people, Osiris’ expanded human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) product Prochymal, appears to be ineffective.  This may be explained by the reports that similar production methods yield dysfunctional cells.  Advanced Cell Technologies (ACT) is developing a method of producing human MSC from embryonic stem cells (hESC-MSC) that they claim produces cells with youthful function.  This proposal aims to use equivalent methods to produce and compare hMSC.

# Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are capable of differentiating into, and believed to provide support for, a wide variety of connective tissues such as bone, muscle, fat, ligament and cartilage (Figure 1) (Ref. 1–4).  They are proposed to be present in nearly all organs and tissues (Ref. 1) and are reported to migrate toward and engraft into sites of damage to induce repair and modulate immune system responses (Ref.1–3).  Transplantation of MSC appears to be efficacious for a wide variety of animal disease models (Ref. 5) as well as clinical indications (Ref. 1) and there has been considerable proof of concept for their use in gene delivery (Ref. 1).  Given that treatment of humans with MSC is reported to be safe (Ref. 2), these cells appear to be a promising avenue for rejuvenation research attempts of treating the diseases of aging.

Figure 1. Mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into a variety of connective tissue types (Ref. 1–4).

In a wide variety of organisms increased age has been associated with diminished MSC number (Ref. 4,6) and function (Ref. 3).  There are reports of decreased differentiation potential (Ref. 3,4,6), migration capability (Ref. 6) as well as proliferation rate (Ref.3,6) with age.  Also, MSC from older organisms appear to have increased oxidative stress (Ref. 3,6) and DNA damage (Ref. 6), higher apoptosis levels (Ref. 3,4) and cell senescence (Ref. 4).  The age-induced dysfunction of MSC has led many to propose that their functional decline plays a role in a variety of age-induced connective tissue diseases (Ref. 3,4,6).  This viewpoint is reinforced by the published ability of MSC from young, but not old mice to maintain healthy bone density and increase lifespan of recipients (Figure 2) (Ref. 6).  The apparent therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells was the motivation behind Osiris’ Prochymal: the first attempt at expanding MSC to meet clinical demand.  

To produce cells on scale Osiris obtains MSC from young healthy donors and expands them in culture (Ref. 2).  Despite all of the literature support for the efficacy of MSC transplants, Prochymal has failed clinical trials for use in COPD and Crohn’s disease along with GVHD and appears to be inefficient at treating diabetes (Ref. 7).  These poor clinical results, despite promising animal and phase II GVHD data, may be explained by the reports that expansion techniques similar to Osiris’ reduce proliferation capability (Ref. 4), differentiation potential (Ref. 8), homing and engraftment ability (Ref. 5), and appear to induce senescence (Ref. 3,5).  Prochymal cells have not yet been tested for a dysfunctional phenotype.  However, if the characteristics of Advanced Cell Technologies’ (ACT) MSC are as “young” as claimed, their product may be better suited for therapeutic use (Ref. 9).

Figure 2. Aging appears to reduce MSC function.  (A) Increased age of MSC source organism is associated with decreased proliferation Ref. 3).  (B) Young, but not old, MSC transplantation resulted in increased lifespan (C) and increased bone density in a mouse model (Ref. 6).

Though ACT’s data has not yet been published, there is preliminary support for their assertion (Ref. 9) that embryonic stem cell derived MSC (ESC-MSC) have youthful immunomodulatory function (Ref. 10).  ESC-MSC and cord blood derived MSC (CB-MSC) have similar immunosuppressive properties which are less profound by those reported for adult MSC (Ref. 10).  The reports that cells produced via similar methods are capable of producing muscle, bone and cartilage in vivo without teratoma formation are interesting (Ref. 8,10).  However, the most intriguing point is that these cells appear to have population doublings above that of adult MSC and an ability to home, and engraft, to inflamed tissue (Figure 3) (Ref. 10).  Advanced Cell Technologies is in pre-clinical development for ESC-MSC production (Ref. 9) and Osiris is attempting to broaden the approved uses of Prochymal (Ref. 7).  A functional comparison of cells produced by these methods may aid in identifying clinical indications for the use of these products in the field of rejuvenation research.

Figure 3. hESC-MSC are reported to have normal function.  (A) Injection of hESC-MSC into an animal model resulted in preferential homing to inflamed tissue and engraftment into a variety of tissue types.  (B) hESC-MSC proliferates faster than bone marrow and cord blood derived MSC (Ref. 10).

# Research Plan
Mesenchymal stem cells, without expansion, are reported to be capable of treating a variety of conditions in animals and humans, but there are mixed reports for the successful use of expanded cells to treat disease.  Given that there are two methods of MSC production being developed, aimed at meeting the clinical need, a comparison of cells produced via these methods and against the traditional transplantation without expansion may aid in determining their therapeutic relevance.  This project aims to compare the function of ex vivo expanded MSC, cord blood derived MSC, bone marrow derived MSC and ESC-MSC using the traditional MSC comparison tests (Ref. 4).  Once the cells are produced, a variety of functional assays, which are described in the methods section, will be employed to compare them.  

### Specific Aims
1. Produce MSC using ESC differentiation method.
2. Produce MSC using ex vivo expansion method.
3. Compare  the function of these cells along with BM and CB derived MSC using Stolzing’s assays (Ref. 4).

# Methods

### Cell Culture
General hMSC culture (Ref. 4), Prochymal hMSC (Ref. 2) expansion and hESC differentiation into hMSC (Ref. 8) will be performed as described in the literature.  Adipogenesis, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis will be induced as is published here (Ref. 10).  

### Microscopy
The differentiation potential of hMSC into fat, cartilage and bone lineage cells will be determined with stains for each of those cell types as reported in the hESC-MSC differentiation paper (Ref. 10).  Quantity of β-galactosidase positive cells will be determined as reported by Stolzing (Ref. 4).

### Flow Cytometry
Apoptosis, cell death, stress resistance4, and cell sorting (Ref. 10) will be performed as previously published.  Quantity of p53 positive cells and the presence of ROS will be determined as reported by Stolzing (Ref. 4).  Population doublings (CellTrace; Life Technologies), average cell telomere length (Flow-FISH kit;Dako) and immunophenotyping (hMSC phenotyping kit; Miltenyi Biotech) will be performed as per manufacturer protocols.
