# Abstract
2 tmm. active repression of telomerase gene by chromatin remodelling of promoters is one way to regulate.
used gene espression profling to uncover signutre of 1305 genes to distingush telomerase positive and ALT cell lines. combined w/ liposarcoma tissue samples refined signtuatre to 297 genes.

# Introduction
cancer unlimited proliferation
high alt frequency in tumors of mesenchymal origin.
77% of malignant fibrous histiocytomas (Henson, Hannay et al., 2005) and
47%-66% of osteosarcomas (Henson, Hannay et al., 2005; Ulaner, Huang et al., 2003) were
shown to be ALT positive, while 25% of glioblastoma multiforme (Hakin-Smith, Jellinek et
al., 2003) and liposarcomas (Costa, Daidone et al., 2006; Johnson, Varkonyi et al., 2005) and
no Ewings sarcomas (Ulaner, Hoffman et al., 2004) showed evidence of ALT.
telomerse genes may be more tightly repressed in mesenchymal tissues over epithelial origin.
hTR and hTERT activley repressed at chromatin level in ALT lines.

A gene expression signature classifying telomerase and ALT immortalisation reveals an hTERT regulatory network and suggests a mesenchymal stem cell origin for ALT
