Dear Kym Imai,
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My name is David Halvorsen and I am excited to be applying for the Saratoga Union School District Data Coordinator position!
I have five years of data analysis experience as an Oncology Research Associate and more than ten years of combined teaching experience as a tutor, a ski instructor, and as the mentor of laboratory interns.
I have just completed the <a href="https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/certificate-program/technology/database-systems">UCSC Database and Data Analytics Certificate</a> and I am excited about the opportunity to combine my data handling and teaching skills to help improve student education outcomes!
Please check out my data analysis blog! <a href="https://davehalvorsen.github.io/Saratoga_Data_Coordinator.html">my data analysis blog</a>
<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn’t particularly academically motivated in middle school because I wasn’t engaged by the traditional classroom environment.
Luckily, my guidance counselor noticed and reviewed vocational training options for me.
The Ulster BOCES Information Technology program sounded exciting, so I enrolled in eleventh grade and fell in love with computers and software!
I realized the importance of science and math through repairing computers, and I’ve had fantastic grades ever since.
<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That academic intervention happened because my counselor had the emotional intelligence to see how I could become a successful student.
It was not a data-based, scalable solution. I was lucky to have a guidance counselor who realized how to help me.
I recently realized that is possible to scale data-based interventions for students while attending the PowerSchool Demos for SIS Showcase and the Unified Classroom Showcase.
I found the PowerSchool Early Warning system to be a fantastic feature, so I wrote about it on <a href="https://davehalvorsen.github.io/software_tools/2018/09/12/PowerSchool-Early-Warning.html">my website at this link</a>.
<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chose biology instead of information technology because my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer while I was in high school;
I was driven to help people like her, and I have! I raised $25,000 for cancer research with <a href="https://davehalvorsen.github.io/assets/OncoSENS_LEF_Grant_Proposal.pdf"> this grant application</a> and I helped raise $70,000 for cancer research by co-presenting in this <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/campaigns/sens-control-alt-delete-cancer/">crowdfunding campaign video</a>.
I am proud to say that the cancer diagnostic that <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2015179557A1/en"> I filed this patent on</a>  is being used free of charge by Dr. Jeremy Henson of UNSW to screen for anti-cancer compounds!
However, I feel that my biggest impact was mentoring students. Many of those students went on to pursue medical school and PhD programs. My youngest intern, high-schooh-aged Thomas Hunt, <a href="https://sens.org/education/education-blog/youngest-thiel-finalist-srfs-thomas-hunt"> won a $100,000 research fellowship</a> !
<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am incredibly proud of the five years that I spent as a biology researcher and, now that I have stronger data skills,
I am excited about how I could help you use data to help your students! I have learned a lot as a student at UCSC. You’ll find fifteen SQL code commits, along with lots of other programs, at my GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/DaveHalvorsen"> https://github.com/DaveHalvorsen</a>. Also, I have written eleven SQL articles on my personal blog: <a href="https://davehalvorsen.github.io/"> https://davehalvorsen.github.io/</a>.
I even built my own computer recently, so the fact that you’re looking for a Data Coordinator that can help with IT adds on to my interest for this Data Coordinator position.
<br><br>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have reviewed all of the data submission requirements that you have (CALPADS, LCAP, Physical Fitness, etc.,) and I am confident my data skills are a great fit.
I am much more excited about how my data analysis skills could help identify students in need of services and support that you could provide.
I chose cancer research because I wanted to make the world a better place. I feel that I can keep making the world a better place as a Data Coordinator for the Saratoga Union School District!
<br><br>
Best,
<br><br>

David Halvorsen
